#Rewrite the Voter Registration Lab utilizing the data from the file voters.csv.  Store the field data into respective 1D lists, and then process the lists to determine the 4 final output values (make sure they are clearly labeled!). This final solution should have NO input() statements and when the console is ran it should print all 4 totals (you may reprint the data from the lists/fie if you would like)  Use your original Voter Registration Lab (or the solution file!) as starter code, but edit it to connect to a file and store data into lists, then use a for loop to process each voter and their data to find the 4 totals.
